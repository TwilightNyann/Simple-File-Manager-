# FileManager
This is a code for a simple file manager application in C++ using wxWidgets library. The application features opening a file, deleting a file/directory, renaming a file/directory, copying file path to clipboard, and displaying information about the application. The file manager interface consists of a directory control on the left, path text control in the middle, and buttons for renaming and copying the file path to the clipboard. The application also has a menu bar with options for opening and exiting the application and deleting a file/directory, and information about the application. The application uses the wxGenericDirCtrl widget to display the file system hierarchy and allows the user to navigate through the directories and select a file. The user can rename a file by entering a new name using wxGetTextFromUser. The user can copy the file path to the clipboard using wxTheClipboard.
